The largest benefit of nuclear energy is the fact that no greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide are emitted during power generation. This means that the production of electricity is very environmentally friendly, which is increasingly important considering the ultimatum of the 2015 Paris Agreement is becoming harder to realize.

Other arguments for nuclear energy are its footprint and energy independence. Whereas wind and solar energy production requires large areas to be occupied, a nuclear power plant only needs 1/75th the space of a solar plant and 1/360th the space of a wind farm. And since The Netherlands largely relies on imported fossil fuels, especially with its own gas field being phased out, it is very dependent on the supply from exporting countries like Russia. The 2022 invasion of Ukraine by Russia has shown without doubt that being dependent on other countries for energy can be a geopolitical catastrophe.
