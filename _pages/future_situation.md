Based on [the intentions of the current Cabinet in Parliament](../../politics/rutteiv/), The Netherlands are getting two new nuclear power plants. This is a process that could take over a decade to complete so it might not be in time to be a critical component of the energy transition, but it should help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future. This does mean that the majority of green energy for the upcoming years will be gained from solar, wind, aquathermal, geothermal and biomass generators.

The only currently operational nuclear power plant, in Borssele, is set to close in 2033.

There is no predicting the future of energy generation in The Netherlands, especially with such an unstable geopolitical landscape and tight deadlines for mitigating global warming. But at the very least the current Cabinet has initiated plans for more nuclear power generation and made the topic negotiable in Parliament.
