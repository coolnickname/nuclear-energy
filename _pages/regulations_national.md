In The Netherlands, the safety and operation of nuclear power plants is governed by the Autoriteit Nucleaire Veiligheid en Stralingsbescherming (ANVS). The authority is set up according to the [requirements of the European Union](../europe) and is responsible for drafting rules, granting permits and enforcing the rules.

A number of measures and precautions that the government can or has taken in order to mitigate the effects of a nuclear crisis are as follows:
- Requiring citizens to take shelter or evacuate.
- Sending iodine tablets to houses in proximity of a nuclear reactor.
- Prohibiting grazing for dairy cattle in polluted areas.
- Prohibiting harvesting and slaughter of crops and animals in polluted areas.
- Closing drinking water pump sites.
- Restrict the market of provisions that have a likelihood of becoming contaminated.

Every part of the process of a nuclear installation is thought out and regulated in the law "Kernenergie wet" (Kew) and ANVS ordinances. From the planning of the construction, to radioactive waste disposal and decades after the facility has been closed. All these regulations can be found on [the site of the ANVS](https://www.autoriteitnvs.nl/) and in the [law Kew](https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0002667/2018-02-06).
