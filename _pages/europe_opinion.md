Currently, the European Union does not see nuclear power generation as a green energy source, which means it is not a fundamental part of the energy transition. This will change on January 1st 2023, when a controversial policy will come into effect that will allow some nuclear and natural gas energy production plans to be considered environmentally sustainable or "green", and therefore qualify for low interest loans and subsidies. 

This policy was voted on on July 6th, with 328 out of 639 present members voting for, which was apparently met with booing from spectators. While the current war in Ukraine was likely an important factor that drove parliamentarians to vote yes on the proposition, the proposal was started half a year before the invasion, when it became clear that the energy transition could not rely solely on wind and solar energy.

Part of the intended effect of the policy is to stop "greenwashing", which is a process where energy projects are purposely mislabelled as environmentally friendly in order to qualify for benefits such as grants. The controversy is because opposing parties claim that labelling nuclear energy and natural gas energy production as green would also constitute greenwashing, given the fact that they both rely on non-renewable and/or fossil fuels. This did not impress the majority of the parliament who, partly because nuclear energy does not produce greenhouse gasses, believes it is a viable alternative energy source to help reach the EU's sustainability goals.
