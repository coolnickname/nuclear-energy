International regulations surrounding all nuclear activities are put forth by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). This agency, established by the United Nations, is currently recognized by 173 member states and provides a framework for safe operation of nuclear power plants and cooperative scientific development for peaceful nuclear solutions.

One of the primal functions of the agency is to collect information on new techniques, methods and research and share this with its member states and parties through the publication of guidelines, standards and recommendations. Although these standards are not legally binding for any of the member states, they are a requirement for all projects that involve help or input from the IAEA.
The standards cover all elements of using nuclear products, from production and transport to medical uses and power generation.  While they contain technical standards they also dictate how national regulatory bodies should be structured, how projects and authorities should be financed, what to do in an emergency, how nuclear facilities should be decommissioned and much more.

The standards are decided very democratically, where every agency, country, organisation or individual who is involved with the topic can give input in how the standards should look. There are currently over 130 standards which cover many more topics than just nuclear power generation, but can all be viewed on [the site of the IAEA](https://www.iaea.org/resources/safety-standards/search).

As part of the international safety framework that the IAEA provides has the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) been created. This is a scale that member states can voluntarily use to express the significance of unusual nuclear activities on public safety. The scales ranges from 1 (anomaly) to 7 (major accident) and does so logarithmically, meaning each level is 10 times more severe than the previous. In case an event is considered not relevant to safety it can be attributed as a level 0 event.
