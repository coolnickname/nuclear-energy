The cabinet of Rutte IV has expressed their interest in using nuclear energy as a supplementary energy source to solar, wind and geothermal energy in its coalition agreement “Omzien naar elkaar, vooruitkijken naar de toekomst”. Their reasoning for this is the reduced dependency on gas and the relatively low carbondioxide emissions. To realise this they have vowed to undertake the necessary steps to construct two new nuclear power plants. In the coalition agreement they have promised to support interested parties with both financial and regulatory means, while also providing safe and permanent storage for nuclear waste.

Furthermore, the cabinet announced to postpone shutting down the nuclear reactor in Borssele, which is currently the only nuclear power plant operational in the Netherlands and set to close in 2033. This is the second time the reactor which originally would be closed in 2004 has had its closure postponed.
