There are a lot of arguments that can be made both for or against nuclear energy. Many times this ends in a dilemma where the advantages have to be weighed against drawbacks. This site is focussed on the ethical and moral dilemmas, so those are the only ones that will be covered. Highly technical details and practical aspects are also not weighed and left as an exercise to the reader.

Some of the dilemmas to consider when forming a well informed opinion on nuclear energy are:
- Whether we are allowed to take the risk to ruin the enviroment for future generations in case a nuclear accident.
- Whether we can burder next generations with our nuclear waste.
- Whether the environmental damage of fossil fuels is worse than the possible destructive power of a nuclear power plant.

There is no straight answer to these questions, but the information on this website can help you answer them for yourself.
