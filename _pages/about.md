This knowledge hub about nuclear energy in The Netherlands and its ethical dilemmas is a product of the Hanze Honours lab 'navigating your moral compass in a technical world'.

Considering most dilemmas do not have a concrete answer, the ambition of this website is to supply the user with correct, current, and objective information, so they may form their own, well-informed opinion. Although no highly technical facts are presented as this is considered out-of-scope for the general ethical dilemmas, special effort has been put into selecting trustworthy sources which are cited on every page, so users who find it worth their time can look deeper into the source material.

Most users would benefit from reading the [dilemmas page](dilemmas/) first and then look at all the other pages until content with their knowledge. In order to help users express their opinion in a meaningful way, this website contains [a list of political parties in the Dutch lower house](politics/parties/) and their opinion on nuclear energy during the 2021 elections.
