Nuclear energy is safe, clean and efficient. Moreover, nuclear power stations hardly take up any of our landscape - unlike the windmills, which the cartel parties are building all over our country and in our sea. FVD therefore wants to build more nuclear power plants and invest in innovative thorium plants.
